Day 3
- add a rule based expert driver (to train imitation learning later)
- add simple rendering so you can see the car driving
- Understand all the physics, math, and design choices in detail

goal - Build a deterministic, hand-crafted controller that can 
drive around the oval track.

this gives -
- baseline test env corectness
- data for behaviour cloning (later)
- a sanity check: your physics + track design works

Building:
	1.	A function that computes the target steering direction
	2.	A speed controller
	3.	A simple expert driver loop
	4.	A basic matplotlib animation render
