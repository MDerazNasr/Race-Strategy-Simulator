day 7 - evakluate expert vs BC (Quantative + Qualitative)

What are we evaluating (and why)
- we compare expert vs Behaviour cloning

core metrics:
- lap completion rate -> can the policy finish the lap
- average episode length -> stability over time
- average reward - overal driving quality
- mean lateral error -> how weel it says centered
- crash/ off track rate -> safety
- Speed profile -> is it timid or agressive

RL interviews love metrics

2 - Define a proper eval protocol
Rules:
- same env
- same random seed distribution
- no exploration noise
- fixed number of episodes
we'll evak each policy on N episodes, record metrics, then comapre means
