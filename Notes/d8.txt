Excellent. **Week 2 – Day 8** is where we **fix BC’s weaknesses and lock it in** so RL can safely start next.

Today is still very ML-focused, but more *surgical*: small changes, big payoff.

---

# 🧠 WEEK 2 — DAY 8

## **Improve BC Generalization + Finalize for RL Initialization**

### 🎯 Goal of Day 8

By the end of today:

1. BC is **stable across randomized starts**
2. BC failures are **understood and mitigated**
3. BC policy is **clean, normalized, and ready** to initialize PPO
4. You can justify *why* BC is a good starting point for RL

Think of today as “BC hardening”.

---

## 1️⃣ Diagnose BC Failure Modes (Think First)

From Day 7, BC usually fails in **three places**:

### Typical BC issues

1. **Over-steering oscillations**
2. **Slow recovery when far from centerline**
3. **Overly cautious speed** (low mean speed)

These are not bugs — they’re *expected*.

---

## 2️⃣ Fix #1: Reduce Over-Steering (Regularization)

### Why it happens

* MSE loss penalizes large errors equally
* Network learns sharp steering corrections
* Leads to oscillations

### Fix: Add **L2 regularization (weight decay)**

📁 **File: `bc/train_bc.py`**

Change optimizer:

```python
optimizer = optim.Adam(
    policy.parameters(),
    lr=learning_rate,
    weight_decay=1e-4,
)
```

### Why `1e-4`?

* Standard value in control tasks
* Encourages smoother weights
* Prevents overfitting to noise

---

## 3️⃣ Fix #2: Penalize Aggressive Steering (Loss Shaping)

We slightly penalize large steering outputs.

### Concept

Instead of pure MSE:

[
L = |a_{pred} - a_{expert}|^2 + \lambda \cdot |a_{pred}|^2
]

This discourages extreme actions.

---

### Implement custom loss

Replace loss computation:

```python
mse_loss = criterion(pred_actions, batch_actions)
action_penalty = 0.01 * torch.mean(pred_actions ** 2)
loss = mse_loss + action_penalty
```

### Why `0.01`?

* Small enough not to dominate
* Big enough to smooth policy

---

## 4️⃣ Fix #3: Improve Recovery Far From Track

### Problem

BC mostly sees *near-center* states.

### Solution: Oversample “bad states”

We already injected noise, but we can do better.

---

### Modify Data Collection (IMPORTANT)

📁 **File: `expert/collect_data.py`**

After stepping the environment:

```python
# After obs update
_, _, _, _, lateral_error, *_ = obs

# If far from centerline, record extra samples
if abs(lateral_error) > 0.6:
    states.append(obs)
    actions.append(action)
```

### Why this works

* Teaches BC how to recover
* Gives more gradient signal where policy is weakest
* Mimics DAgger-lite behavior (without complexity)

---

## 5️⃣ Fix #4: Normalize Actions During Training

### Why

* Even with Tanh, gradients can be uneven
* Helps stable optimization

### Add action normalization

In dataset `__getitem__`:

```python
action = torch.clamp(action, -1.0, 1.0)
```

(This is mostly safety, but good practice.)

---

## 6️⃣ Retrain BC (Clean Run)

Now re-run:

```bash
python -m expert.collect_data
python -m bc.train_bc
python -m bc.eval_bc
```

### What you should observe now

* Less oscillation
* Better recovery
* Slightly higher lap completion
* Slightly smoother trajectories

---

## 7️⃣ Quantitative Re-check (Mini Day 7 Repeat)

Re-run evaluation harness and confirm:

| Metric             | Expected   |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Lap completion     | ↑ or same  |
| Mean lateral error | ↓          |
| Mean speed         | ↑ slightly |
| Reward             | ↑          |

If something regresses badly → revert last change.

---

## 8️⃣ Freeze BC Policy (IMPORTANT)

Once satisfied:

📁 Save final policy:

```python
torch.save(policy.state_dict(), "bc/bc_policy_final.pt")
```

Do **not** touch this again.
This becomes your **RL initialization**.

---

## 9️⃣ ML Concepts You Just Learned (Big Ones)

You now understand:

* Regularization in control policies
* Loss shaping
* Data reweighting / oversampling
* Why BC is *initialization*, not final solution
* How to debug learned control policies

These are **core robotics ML skills**.

---

## ✅ Day 8 Checklist

* [ ] BC policy smoother
* [ ] Fewer oscillations
* [ ] Better recovery
* [ ] Final BC model saved
* [ ] Ready to initialize RL

---

## 🔥 Big Milestone

You have now completed:

* A physics-based environment
* A rule-based expert
* A robust imitation policy
* Proper evaluation & diagnosis

That’s already **stronger than most ML side projects**.

---

## 🚀 Next: **Week 2 – Day 9**

Tomorrow we:

* Prepare PPO configuration
* Load BC weights into RL
* Train RL agent *starting from BC*
* Watch performance jump in minutes instead of hours

When you’re ready, say **continue** and we go full RL.
