Day 4 - Behaviour CLoning(BC)

Teaching a neural net to imitate your expert driver

1. collect a dataset (state, action) pairs from the expert

2. Save it to a disk

3. Build a PyTorch MLP policy and train it with supervised learning

4. Make sure you understand every line, shapes, math and why

What is Behviour Cloning?

- you have an expert driver - a hand-coded controller:
    ExpertDriver.get_action(car)

- For each time step:
    - The environment gives you a state (what the car "sees")
    - The expert gives you an action (throttle, steering)
- Behaviour cloning trains a neural network π_θ(state) ≈ action_expert

- This is just supervised learning:
    - input: state vector (numbers)
    - Targets: action vector (throttle, steer)
    - Loss: Mean Squared Error between predicted and expert actions

Later, RL agens will start from this policy (so it doesnt learn from scratch)
